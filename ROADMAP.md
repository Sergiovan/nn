# ROADMAP

This document describes how the project will proceed, roughly, mostly, probably, at least if I have something to say about it. 

The DONE section shows milestones already reached.

The TODO section shows semi-psuedo-vaguely-immediate issues that should be tackled. 

The IMMEDIATE FUTURE section shows what's upcoming next.
The FUTURE section shows what's to happen in a non-chronological, semi-accurate, per-release basis.

The WHISHLIST section shows things that I would like to get done at some point because I think they're neat.

## DONE
- There doesn't seem to be anything here yet...

## TODO
For v0.0.1.
- **Translation**:
    - Spec:

## IMMEDIATE FUTURE
