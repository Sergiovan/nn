# ROADMAP

This document describes how the project will proceed, roughly, mostly, probably, at least if I have something to say about it. Note that each version is a feature target, meaning if v0.1 is "Better C" then v0.0.* are all implementing that, and v0.1 has it all implemented.

- **v0.0**: Project start.
- **v0.1**: Better c. See [explanation](./roadmap/0100_BETTER_C_NN.md)
    - Mostly only language features that overlap with C, with nn syntax:
        - Basic datatypes signed and unsigned integers, float, double, boolean, void.
        - Declaring and defining variables, functions, structs, untagged unions, enums. 
        - Pointers.
        - if, while, match-case, goto, loop-while, break, continue, return.
        - Integer and string literals.
        - Type aliases.
    - Following exceptions to C:
        - import instead of #include.
        - label statement for labels.
        - extern blocks, for C functions.
        - No ternary operator.
        - No default fallthrough on switch-case.
        - No preprocessor.
        - No declaring anything volatile, register, inline, restrict, static, keywords with _.
        - No arrays.
        - No arrow syntax for dereferencing.
        - No asm.
        - No bitfields.
    - From code to LLVM backend.
- **v0.2**: Internal rearrangement.
    - Proper import rules
    - "asynchronous" compilation.
- **v0.3**: Basic nn features. See [explanation](./roadmap/0300_BASIC_NN.md)
    - any, char, error, tuple, array.
    - raise, defer, try-catch, for statements.
    - namespaces and name importing.
    - Multiaccess and select operators.
    - Uniform function call syntax.
    - new and delete.
    - if, while, match initializers.
    - if, for, while, match, block expressions.
    - Named blocks.
    - void initialization, zero by default.
    - type type, type properties, typeof.
    - Advanced literals.
    - Literal identifiers (syntax for keywords as identifiers)
    - Type inference.
    - Multiple return.
    - Nested functions.
    - Lambdas.

    - Bit operators.
    - Destructuring.
    - Anonymous variables, functions, types.
    - this, This, struct/enum/union functions.

    - Advanced pointer types.
    - Moving vs Copying.
    - Import/Export (libraries).
    - Constructors/Destructors.
    - Operator overloading.
- **v0.6**: Low level stuff.
    - Asm blocks.
    - Bitfields.
    - Alignment.
    - Data at specific locations.
- **v0.7**: Non-LLVM backend.
    - x86_64-linux?
    - RISC-V-none
- **v0.8**: Bootstrap.
    - What else to say?
- **v0.9**: Polish.
