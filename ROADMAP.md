# ROADMAP

This document describes how the project will proceed, roughly, mostly, probably, at least if I have something to say about it. Note that each version is a feature target, meaning if v0.1 is "Better C" then v0.0.* are all implementing that, and v0.1 has it all implemented.

- **v0.0**: Project start.
- **v0.1**: Better c.
    - Mostly only language features that overlap with C, with nn syntax:
        - Basic datatypes signed and unsigned integers, float, double, boolean, void.
        - Declaring and defining variables, functions, structs, untagged unions, enums. 
        - Pointers.
        - if, while, match-case, goto, loop-while, break, continue, return.
        - Integer and string literals.
        - extern blocks, for C functions.
    - Following exceptions to C:
        - null instead of NULL.
        - import instead of #include.
        - label statement for labels.
        - if expression instead of ternary operator.
        - No default fallthrough on switch-case.
        - No typedef but using statement.
        - No preprocessor.
        - No declaring anything volatile, register, inline, restrict, static, keywords with _.
        - No arrays.
        - No arrow syntax for dereferencing.
        - No asm.
        - No bitfields.
    - From code to LLVM backend.
- **v0.2**: Internal rearrangement.
    - Proper import rules
    - "asynchronous" compilation.
- **v0.3**: Basic nn features.
    - Multiple return.
    - any, char, error, tuple, array.
    - raise, defer, try-catch, for statements.
    - namespaces and name importing.
    - Multiaccess and select operators.
    - Uniform function call syntax.
    - new and delete.
    - if, while, match initializers.
    - match expression.
    - block expression.
    - void initialization, zero by default.
    - type type, type properties.
    - Literal identifiers (syntax for keywords as identifiers)
    - Type inference.
    - Lambdas.
    - Captures for functions.
    - Bit operators, destructuring.
    - Anonymous variables, functions, types.
    - this, struct/enum/union functions.
- **v0.4**: Compiletime code, metaprogramming and notes.
    - Types as compiletime expressions.
    - Compiletime-only variables and functions.
    - Generics.
    - Static code generation.
    - Conditional compilation.
    - Compiletime folding.
    - Running programs as scripts.
    - Compiler directives as code.
- **v0.5**: Advanced nn features.
    - Tagged unions.
    - Pattern matching.
    - Generators.
    - dyanmic and static overloading.
    - Advanced pointer types.
    - Moving vs Copying.
    - Import/Export (libraries).
    - Constructors/Destructors.
    - Operator overloading.
- **v0.6**: Low level stuff.
    - Asm blocks.
    - Bitfields.
    - Alignment.
    - Data at specific locations.
- **v0.7**: Non-LLVM backend.
    - x86_64-linux?
    - RISC-V-none
- **v0.8**: Bootstrap.
    - What else to say?
- **v0.9**: Polish.
    - Command line interface.
    - Error and warning handling.
    - Tests.
- **v1.0**: Compiler!
