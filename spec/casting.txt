# Weak casting

`u0` casts to and from nothing
Nothing can be cast to `---`.
Everything else casts to itself (NO-OP)
Everything except for `null` can be cast to `any` (Makes any object)
Everything except for `null` and `---` can be cast to `infer` (Type inference, compile-time only)
Unsigneds can be upcast (NO-OP)
Signeds can be upcast (NO-OP)
Characters can be upcast (NO-OP)
Null can be cast to `ptr`, `uptr` and `sptr` (0 with ptr type)

# Strong casting (In addition to weak casting rules)
Everything except for `type`, `array`, `struct`, `tuple` and `fun` can be cast to `u1` (0, null and empty any are falsy, everything else is truthy)
All numbers can be cast to each other (downcasting truncates)
All charactes can be cast to each other (downcasting truncats)
Characters, errors, pointers and types can be cast to unsigneds and viceversa. (as-is conversion)
`any` can be cast to anything (Unboxes value as if it were valid)
`uptr`, `sptr` and `wptr` can be cast to `ptr` of the same pointed at type (Takes a copy of the pointer that won't self-destruct)
`sptr` can be cast to `wptr` of the same pointed at type and viceversa (sptr->wptr makes a weak pointer, wptr->sptr locks the weak pointer, null if sptr is gone)
`ptr` can be cast to `ptr` if one of them is pointer to `u8`
