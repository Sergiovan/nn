Yielding and coroutines:
Coroutine objects are not normal function pointers, they hold their own stack. Functions with "yield" are coroutines. Coroutines must have an ending "return" or "raise" that's always reached.

Typeof:
"typeof <iden>" or "typeof <type>", returns a number. Runtime types also available if used.

Sizeof: 
"sizeof <iden>" or "sizeof <type>", returns the number of bytes the type takes, sans extras (like type info, etc)

any array:
"any[] <iden>", gives an array of arbitrary types. Values need to be converted before use.

Generic functions:
"<returns> <iden> <any as K, int, double, string as V> <params>" (Syntax not final)

Generic struct:
"struct <iden> <any as K, int, double, string as V> <struct>" (Syntax not final)

Combination type casting:
"<{typename or number; colon}>" allows reordering or ditching of combination types' types
"<let>" allows for automatic reordering based on context clues (only for assignments)

Multicasting:
"<a -> b>" casts to a, then to b. Chainable
