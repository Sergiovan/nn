Types:
 - Pointer types: arrays, pointers and functions
 - Integers: byte, short, int, long
 - Reals: float, double
Weak cast: (Implicit)
 - To itself
 - To Nothing
 - To let
 - Pointer types to null
 - Functions to their pure version
 - Integers to larger integers
 - Reals to larger reals
 - Combinations to other combinations if all members can be weak cast
Strong cast: (Explicit)
 - Any weak cast
 - Primitives, functions and pointers to boolean
 - Any number type to another number type
 - Casting to and from sig
 - Casting to and from char
 - Casting boolean to numbers
 - Casting long to pointer types
 - Casting naked pointers to byte*
 - Casting byte* to naked pointers
 - Shared pointers to weak pointers
TODO:
 - String and char to byte*
 - Casting between pointer types
